# Probabilistic Machine Learning

This is a short course on probabilistic machine learning using Python 3.8 and PyMC3. The course is focussed on the practical application of probabilistic modelling and most of the material is presented in Jupyter notebooks using Python.

The notebooks for the course may be run locally on your own machine by installing Python 3.8 and PyMC3, or by using Google

### Installing Python 3.8 and PyMC3

To install Python 3.8 on your own machine, along with the necessary libraries, use the installer available at [Anacoina](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). Then follow the instructions [here](https://docs.pymc.io) to install PyMC3.

### Using Google Colab

The Google Colab website supports the generation and running of Jupyter notebooks in the cloud and has all the necessary libraries installed. It may be accessed [here](https://colab.research.google.com/).
